# Digit wise sum
I created this small project to implement a simple puzzle, called digit wise sum.

A digit wise sum is an addition between two non-negative integer number, where the first addendum and the result are both expressed as an
array of the base 10 digits composing the number. 

Here is an example: `[3, 4, 5] + 2500 = [2, 8, 4, 5]`
